      <h2>CAREER SUMMARY</h2>
      <p>As a skilled AWS DevOps Engineer, I bring a results-driven approach to delivering innovative technology solutions
        that optimize business operations. With a strong background in Linux/Unix system administration and cloud support,
        I excel in troubleshooting complex issues and providing technical support to users. My expertise in
        infrastructure as code (IAC) using tools like Terraform, as well as my proficiency in Docker and AWS ECS, makes
        me a valuable asset to any DevOps team. I have a deep understanding of user and group management, configuration
        management, and implementing technology-based solutions that enhance business functionality.</p>

        <h3>AWS Cloud Resume Challenge</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>This resume is a responsive web page hosted on Amazon S3, the other AWS services I used include, Route
            53, AWS lambda, AWS API-Gateway, DynamoDB, AWS IAM and VPC.</li>
        </ul>

      <div class="project">
        <h3>AWS Three-tier Web Application</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>I built and hosted webapp on AWS. 
            It doesn't do much, it collects you name as input and returns a greeting from Lambda.
            The highlight of the project however is the different AWS service I combined to arrive at the end result.
             I connected the WebApp to a serverless backend (AWS Lambda) and then finally I added some
            interactivity with Aws Api-Gateway and Database, services I used include AWS Amplify, Amazon API Gateway, AWS Lambda,
            AWS IAM, Amazon DynamoDB.<a href="https://dev.d3so1fz6r3jf4d.amplifyapp.com/" target="_blank">Check it out</a></li>
